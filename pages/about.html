		percent of cases) than woman (14 percent)."
		Women are extremely picky. Compound that with the fact that the ratio of men to women on dating apps is sometimes as high as 2:1 and you realize you've got a problem. (BusinessofApps) The best profiles can get hundreds of swipes, while the rest
		of us are left in the dust. For us, the average looking guys, it can almost feel like we have a better chance of winning the lottery than getting more matches.

		then the ‘bottom’ 80% of men were in essence competing for the bottom 22% of women, while the top 78% of women were competing for the top 20% of men. (BusinessofApps)
